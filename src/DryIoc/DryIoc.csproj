## v4.1.0 Feature release

### Highlights

- Better memory use and massively improved performance for the real-world applications - big object graphs and the unit-of-work scenarios. See the updated benchmark results in [readme.md].(https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc/blob/master/README.md#creating-the-container-registering-the-services-then-opening-a-scope-and-resolving-the-scoped-service-eg-controller-for-the-first-time))
- Improve parallelism / reduce thread blocking #137
- Full and fast DryIoc own Interpretation support via `Rules.WithUseInterpretation()` - useful for iOS and other platforms without compilation support #90
- Copied DryIoc sample project from the MediatR but with DryIoc.Messages #117 

### Features

- Interpretation only option #90 
- Add RegisterDelegate with the list of dependencies to Inject and not to Resolve #147
- Lift restrictions for Scope disposal when using ambient ScopeContext #168 
- FactoryDelegate<T> wrapper support #191
- Add Rules.UseDecorateeReuseForDecorators #201

### Fixes

- Resolving a component for the second time throws #130
- Stackoverflow exception #139
- Xamarin Forms iOS: Operation is not supported on this platform. #156
- DryIoc 4.0.5 withoutFastExpressionCompiler deadlock issue #157
- Rules.WithDependencyDepthToSplitObjectGraph is not propagated through most of `Rules.With` methods #163
- Rules.WithDependencyDepthToSplitObjectGraph was not applied in some cases with Decorators in graph #164
- Made.Of() Parameters don't follow Reuse setting #179
- ThreadScopeContext not working in DryIoc.dll 4.1.0-preview-02? #183
- ReflectionTools methods unexpectedly return static constructors #184
- Container creates multiple instances if TryInterpret fails #188
- Open-generic implementation may be wrongly considered for service with many type args #190
- DryIOC new Transient Disposable #192

- fixed: #97: Resolving last registration from multiple default services bug
- fixed: #89: DryIoC.CommonServiceLocator.dll package out-of-date link

## v4.0.0 Release notes

### Highlights

- DryIoc.dll and all extensions are strongly-signed.
- Greatly improved performance and decreased memory allocations for bootstrapping and first-time resolution, as well as for the rest of operations. [The results](https://github.com/dadhi/DryIoc/issues/26#issuecomment-466460255) were measured on realistic mid-sized object graph with ~40 dependencies and mixed registration types.
- `IResolver` is directly implementing (`IServiceProvider`)[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.iserviceprovider?view=netframework-4.7.2] for supported platforms
- `UseInstance` is split into `RegisterInstance` and `Use` methods #78
- The docs now are generated from `.cs` files in _DryIoc.Docs_ project with up-to-date runnable examples using [CsToMd](https://github.com/dadhi/Cstomd) project.

### Features

- added: #4 Rule for Func and Lazy to be resolved even without requested service registered
- added: #8 Parity of registration methods between IContainer and IRegistrator (RegisterMapping and RegisterPlaceholder are available in IRegistrator)

- added: #20 Enhance error message with current container Rules info
- added: #32 Integrate MediatR like middleware directly to DryIoc #32
- added: #39 For troubleshooting purposes add ability to opt-out FastExpressionCompiler 
- Added: #45 Consider expression interpretation to speed-up first time resolution
- added: #78 Split UseInstance two roles into separate RegisterInstance and Use
- added: DryIoc IResolver now directly implements IServiceProvider - no need for BuildServiceProvider anymore
- added: DryIoc.Rules.Rules.MicrosoftDependencyInjectionRules - the set of rules for MS.DI available directly in DryIoc
- added: FactoryInfo.Of(MemberInfo factoryMember, object factoryInstance)
- added: Explicit Factory.RegistrationOrder and adapted its usage for open-generics
- added: IRegistrator.GetRegisteredFactories
- added: FactoryType to Registrator.RegisterMapping
